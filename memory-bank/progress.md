2025-06-15 17:16:52 - Initial creation of Progress file.

*

## Completed Tasks

*   Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
*   Created `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

## Current Tasks

*   Create `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`, `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`, and `memory-bank/progress.md`.
*   Implement diary entry functionality in `tracker.py`.

## Next Steps

*   Test and refine the diary entry functionality.
2025-06-15 18:08:39 - Medication Feature Plan Added:

**Phase 1: Data Structure**

We need to modify the existing data structure to accommodate medication information.  I propose adding a new section to `data.json` to store medication details.  Each medication will be represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

*   `name`: The name of the medication (string).
*   `doses_per_day`: The number of doses to be taken daily (integer).

Example:

```json
{
  "medications": [
    {
      "name": "Aspirin",
      "doses_per_day": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "Ibuprofen",
      "doses_per_day": 3
    }
  ],
  // ... rest of the data
}
```

**Phase 2: User Interface (prompts.py)**

The `prompts.py` file will need to be updated to handle medication input.  A new function will be added to prompt the user to add new medications.  This function will ask for the medication name and the number of doses per day.  Error handling will be implemented to ensure valid input.

**Phase 3: Daily Input (tracker.py)**

The `tracker.py` file will be modified to incorporate the medication data into the daily input prompts.  The existing daily input function will be updated to iterate through the list of medications and prompt the user to input the number of doses taken for each medication.  Data validation will be included to ensure that the input is within the expected range (0 to `doses_per_day`).

**Phase 4: Data Persistence (data_io.py)**

The `data_io.py` file will be updated to handle the saving and loading of medication data.  New functions will be added to write the medication data to `data.json` and to read the medication data from `data.json`.

**Phase 5: Testing**

Thorough testing will be conducted to ensure that all aspects of the medication feature are functioning correctly.  This will involve testing the addition of new medications, the daily input prompts, and the data persistence mechanisms.


**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Interface (prompts.py)] --> B(Add Medication);
    B --> C{Valid Input?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Data Structure (data.json)];
    C -- No --> E[Error Handling];
    D --> F[Daily Input (tracker.py)];
    F --> G{Input Valid?};
    G -- Yes --> H[Data Persistence (data_io.py)];
    G -- No --> I[Error Handling];
    H --> J[Data Saved];
    J --> K[Testing];
    E --> K;
    I --> K;
```

This plan outlines the key steps involved in implementing the medication feature.  It addresses data structure, user interface, daily input, data persistence, and testing.  The Mermaid diagram visually represents the flow of information and actions.

[2025-06-15 18:13:10] - Completed medication tracking feature implementation:
- Added medication data structure to data.json
- Implemented medication prompts in prompts.py
- Updated tracker.py with medication tracking
- Added medication management to menu.py
- Verified all components work together
