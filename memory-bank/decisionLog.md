# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-06-15 17:17:02 - Initial creation of Decision Log file.

*

## Decision

*   Create a Memory Bank to track project progress and decisions.

## Rationale 

*   To maintain context and facilitate efficient task completion.

## Implementation Details

*   Created `memory-bank/` directory and core Markdown files.
[2025-06-15 20:28:15] - Medication data structure bug identified
## Decision
Need to fix medication data overwrite issue that creates nested structures

## Rationale
When overwriting existing medication entries, the system incorrectly nests the same key multiple times instead of maintaining the simple structure defined in medications.json

## Implementation Details
Will need to modify data saving logic in data_io.py to properly handle medication data structure
[2025-06-15 20:28:45] - Data I/O analysis complete
## Decision
The medication data structure issue is not in data_io.py

## Rationale 
The data_io.py file correctly handles the medication data structure when loading/saving. The issue must be in how the data is modified before saving.

## Implementation Details
Need to examine tracker.py next to find where the medication data is being processed incorrectly
[2025-06-15 20:29:10] - Medication bug root cause identified
## Decision
Need to fix medication data merging in tracker.py

## Rationale
The `prompt_medication_data()` returns correct flat structure, but data is being nested incorrectly when merged with existing data in `modify_past_future_data()`

## Implementation Details
Will modify the data merging logic to maintain flat medication structure when saving
[2025-06-15 20:30:00] - Medication bug fix implemented
## Decision
Fixed medication data structure issue in tracker.py

## Rationale
Modified data merging logic to maintain flat medication structure when saving

## Implementation Details
- Added explicit comment about flat structure
- Ensured medication_data from prompt_medication_data() is saved directly without nesting
- Verified change in tracker.py lines 260-270
[2025-06-15 20:33:00] - Migrated existing nested medication data
## Decision
Fixed nested medication data in 2025-06-15.json

## Rationale
Manually flattened the nested structure to match the new expected format

## Implementation Details
- Extracted dose value from deep nesting
- Saved with simple {"medication_name": dose} structure
- Verified structure matches fixed tracker.py output
[2025-06-16 11:09:27] - Project file reorganization for improved modularity
## Decision
Reorganized project files to improve modularity and logical separation of concerns.
## Rationale
To enhance code maintainability, readability, and facilitate future development by grouping related functionalities into distinct files (e.g., `diary.py`, `exercises.py`, `time_activities.py`). This also aligns with the principle of single responsibility.
## Implementation Details
- Moved diary-related functions to `diary.py`.
- Moved exercise-related functions to `exercises.py`.
- Moved time activity-related functions to `time_activities.py`.
- Updated imports and function calls across affected files (`tracker.py`, `menu.py`, `prompts.py`) to reflect new file locations.
