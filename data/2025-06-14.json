  "diary_entry": "Through the morning until the afternoon paine was pretty good then I had a gig well one of the members was a bit late so we were really frantic to get onstage so ended up moving a bit of stuff and I also played tambourine and bruised my hand a little bit so I was a bit sore by the time I finish playing. There were some burning in the fingers that lasted about an hour or so and I also bruised my palm a little bit. I'm thinking of getting a mounted tambourine so I can hit it with a drumstick."
